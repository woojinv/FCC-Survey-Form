# Hebron Youth Group Survey Form

## Description

This is a [survey form](https://woojinv.github.io/FCC-Survey-Form/) for my Church's youth group to provide an opportunity for the students to share feedback they may have. 

It was built using only **HTML** and **CSS** for Part 2 of FreeCodeCamp's *Responsive Web Design Certification*. 


## What I learned

I became more comfortable using CSS Flexbox, custom properties, and rem units.
