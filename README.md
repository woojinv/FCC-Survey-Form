# Hebron Youth Group Survey Form

## Description

This is a survey form for my Church's youth group to provide an opportunity for the students to share feedback they may have. 

It was built using only HTML and CSS for Part 2 of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification. 


## What I learned

I became more comfortable using CSS Flexbox, custom properties, and rem units.
